			p After meeting them at a hackathon, Unitu was my primary development position #[strong for two and a half years]. I started as a part-time #[strong Android developer] and gradually took on more and more responsibilities.

			p Initially, I was tasked to develop a #[a(href = '/projects#unitu-android-app') #[strong brand new Android app]] for the platform. The app was made available to #[strong thousands of UK university students] and remained one of my main roles, but I also took technical lead on a #[a(href = '/projects#unitu-analytics') #[strong bespoke analytics system]].

			p When I moved to a full-time role in September 2015, I also started contributing to the #[a(href = '/projects#unitu-web-api') #[strong website and API]], and throughout 2016 I worked on developing #[strong closer technical integrations] with university systems.

			p At KCL, I was a teaching assistant for the #[strong Advanced Practical Topics] course. The module gave students insights on a range of technical and programming topics that are not usually covered, including Unix, Python, version control and mobile development.

			p I also delivered #[a(href = '/projects#android-lectures') #[strong Android development lectures]] as part of the #[em Build X] course ran by the KCL Tech Society, and assisted with other lessons on beginner programming and website development.

			p Finally, as a student, I have achieved a grade of #[strong 89%] so far, putting me on track for a first class degree.

			p Whilst with the #[strong PMO] department I worked on collating weekly international project reports, software testing, software documentation and numerous #[strong MS SharePoint] tasks. I invested a little time into automating several aspects of these jobs, leaving me with spare time to work with the #[strong IT] department.

			p With the #[strong IT] department I worked mostly on setting up and customising a #[strong FOG server] to allow their technicians to automate workstation re-imaging, as well as helping to further automate some of their #[strong MS SharePoint] support tickets.

			p I was stationed in a #[strong very small, remote village in Guyana, South America], where I worked as a full-time secondary school teacher. Whilst there I #[strong taught mostly maths], a little reading and PE, and gave several classes for adults in the village (including basic ICT skills and first aid).

			p During the year I was lucky enough to visit seven countries, try a great many new experiences, and gain some incredibly #[strong valuable skills] (and some great stories!).

Most of the work was carried out on #[strong LAMP servers], first rented from third parties and later set up manually on VPSs.

			p I managed all aspects of the business, including sales, consultancy, production, support and accounting. Over the years I maintained a client base of #[strong individuals and business] of various sizes, in the UK and overseas.

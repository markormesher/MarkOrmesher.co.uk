			p Mark has been an #[strong exceptional addition] to the Unitu team. He possesses both technical and character skills that not only get tasks done extremely efficiently but also help push the company forward.
			p He embodies the company philosophy - #[em Impossible is nothing] - and brings traits that inspire and motivate other team members.
			p He managed to build the #[a(href = '/projects#unitu-android-app') Unitu Android App] within less than 3 months and go FAR beyond the given specification. He took complete ownership over his work and dedicated himself fully with #[strong absolute care and precision].
			p In addition to this, he is also #[strong loyal, committed and ambitious]. As a co-founder of Unitu, I am both proud and thrilled to be working along side him, knowing that with Mark on our team we can achieve anything. I am available to provide an extensive recommendation for Mark, so please don't hesitate to contact me.

			p Mark is #[strong a very able student] - I taught him on two of his first-year programming modules, and was #[strong surprised and impressed] with the quality of the work he produced.
			p His academic abilities are backed up by #[strong solid practical skills]: he has a keen eye for detail, producing code that is well-designed and well-tested. He is actively involved in working with other students here at King's, both through the KCL Tech Society, and through assisting in our hands-on first-year advanced programming topics course.
			p I have no hestitation in recommending Mark for suitable jobs, internships and so on - please get in touch if you would like a formal reference.

			p I've had the pleasure of working with Mark on several occasions in different environments and on a handful of projects. Whether we've worked together in the same company, collaboratively in hackathons or on a university side-project, I have to say that #[strong there's no one else I'd rather work with].
			p Mark is punctual and supportive, and when it comes to his work, you'll always find it #[strong perfect]. Mark has pays excellent attention to detail, and puts all of his effort in making anything he builds the best it could be.
			p He's one of the few people I've met that have #[strong a true passion] for what they do, and I think that's the reason why he's simply unique at it.

			p I'm very happy to have been able to work with Mark over the course of the past year in several capacities, but mostly as part of KCL's Tech Society - Mark has been #[strong an invaluable member] of the committee, showing time and time again his passion for what he does, his eye for detail and his ability to produce work above and beyond expectations.
			p His character, work ethos and technical ability make him #[strong a fantastic addition] to any truly deserving team.

			p I was fortunate to meet Mark at a King's Uni Careers Event. I was struck by his #[strong excellent attitude and skill set] within a few moments of our first conversation. Consequently it was my pleasure to facilitate a summer Internship at Excelian.
			p He became part of the team very quickly, acted on his own initiative, #[strong provided new ideas for old challenges], and was considered a welcome addition to the Company.
			p I can only say that the next Company that is fortunate to benefit from his #[strong talent and experience], will be making a smart move when they hire him!

			p Working with Mark was an absolute pleasure and overall a great experience. He brought #[strong drive and enthusiasm] to the change team whilst maintaining #[strong excellent communication] throughout his project.
			p He delivered a solution that not just met but #[strong exceeded the requirements] of his brief, on time and on budget. I would without doubt have Mark work with us again!

			p We're so thrilled that you joined us for one of your internships and you've #[strong contributed a huge amount] in a very short space of time. Your most significant contribution was the #[a(href = '/projects#petplan-live') dashboard], which has enabled us to engage our people in our KPIs with something #[strong considerably more exciting] than a graph or a report.
			p You've also left it so that we can update it easily and other areas of the business have already seen it and want to replicate it! Despite you not having worked in a call centre before, I was #[strong hugely impressed with your professionalism, work ethic and ability to engage people] at various different levels. I only wish you could have stayed longer!

		strong.text-highlight Hi, I'm Mark!
		|  I'm a #[strong software developer] and student in London, and I've been writing code in various forms #[strong since 2005]. I'm currently studying Computer Science at <strong>King's College London</strong> and working for #[strong Unitu] as a developer on a number of #[a(href='/projects') projects].

	p.intro Outside of coding, I've also #[a(href='/positions') worked] as a #[strong teacher], hardware technician and salesman.

	p.intro I launched my first website at the age of 12, and I haven't put the keyboard down since. Writing <strong>quality code</strong> is not only a job for me, but also <strong>a hobby and a passion</strong>. I'm a regular hackathon attendee, I maintain a few personal projects, and I take every chance I get to <strong>play with new languages</strong> and learn more about the ones I already know.

		strong JavaScript/CoffeeScript &amp; jQuery
		span.text-muted  //
		|  I have been using #[em JavaScript] to drive the client-side of my web projects since I began in 2005, and I've been using #[em jQuery] and #[em jQuery UI] to support that work since 2008. In 2014 I began playing with #[em CoffeeScript], mostly out of curiosity and interest; I still use it when I have projects that will involve a lot of front-end #[em JS].

	p
		strong HTML/Jade &amp; (S)CSS
		span.text-muted  //
		|  My first foray into coding was a very basic website, &quot;powered&quot; by vanilla #[em HTML] and  #[em CSS]. I quickly moved on to more interesting areas of web development, but I still use #[em HTML] and #[em CSS] on a near-daily basis for the web components in my projects. Since 2015 I often use #[em Jade] and #[em SCSS] to augment the front-end sections of any Node.js #[a(href='/projects') projects] I work on.
